# RDFedit - Mobile RDF editor

This is a naive RDF editor built with (spaghetti-ish) jQuery (UI) code. My goal is to take the ideas a step further and re-building it with BackboneJS, RequireJS and some UI lib which might still be jQuery UI or something like Twitter's Bootstrap.

Backend-wise the ARC2 lib will remain the weapon of choice although other DB systems could be worth a try.
